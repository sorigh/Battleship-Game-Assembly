# âš“ Battleship Game in Assembly

This project implements a simple Battleship game using x86 assembly language, where two players can place ships, attack each other's ships, and track their scores. The game is played on two separate boards for each player, and it uses a graphical interface to display the boards, ships, and scores.

## Features

- **Player Interaction**: Players can click on the board to attack their opponent's ships.
- **Ship Placement**: Ships are randomly placed on the board at the start of the game.
- **Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of hits, misses, and remaining ships for each player.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The board updates in real-time, reflecting player actions.
